                <li>Most people are not very familiar with the concept of artificial intelligence (AI). As an
                    illustration, when 1,500 senior business leaders in the United States in 2017 were asked about AI,
                    only 17 percent said they were familiar with it.[1] A number of them were not sure what it was or
                    how it would affect their particular companies. They understood there was considerable potential for
                    altering business processes, but were not clear how AI could be deployed within their own
                    organizations. Below I am Attching a video related to AI please listen it......</li> <br>

                <li>Despite its widespread lack of familiarity, AI is a technology that is transforming every walk of
                    life. It is a wide-ranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze
                    data, and use the resulting insights to improve decisionmaking. Our hope through this comprehensive
                    overview is to explain AI to an audience of policymakers, opinion leaders, and interested observers,
                    and demonstrate how AI already is altering the world and raising important questions for society,
                    the economy, and governance.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>In this paper, we discuss novel applications in finance, national security, health care, criminal
                    justice, transportation, and smart cities, and address issues such as data access problems,
                    algorithmic bias, AI ethics and transparency, and legal liability for AI decisions. We contrast the
                    regulatory approaches of the U.S. and European Union, and close by making a number of
                    recommendations for getting the most out of AI while still protecting important human values.</li>
